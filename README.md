# Ideal Postcodes Ruby Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ideal-postcodes/ideal-postcodes-ruby.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ideal-postcodes/ideal-postcodes-ruby)

Ideal Postcodes is a simple JSON API to query UK postcodes and addresses. Find out more at [Ideal-Postcodes.co.uk](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/)

Our API uses Royal Mail's Postcode Address File and is updated daily. Each method incurs a small charge (typically 2p) - free methods are labelled as such and are based on open data sources.

## Getting Started

**Install**

```bash
gem install ideal_postcodes
```

Alternatively, include this in your gemfile and bundle install

```ruby
gem 'ideal_postcodes'
```

**Create a Key**

Sign up at [Ideal-Postcodes.co.uk](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk) and create a key.

**Configure**

Drop in your key when using the library.

```ruby
IdealPostcodes.api_key = "your_key_goes_here"
```

## Error Handling

It's important that you lookout for common exceptions when interacting with the API. The most common exceptions can be caught as shown below.

```ruby
begin
  IdealPostcodes::Postcode.lookup "ID1 1QD"
rescue IdealPostcodes::AuthenticationError => e
	# Invalid API Key
rescue IdealPostcodes::TokenExhaustedError => e
	# Token has run out of lookups
rescue IdealPostcodes::LimitReachedError => e
	# One of your predefinied limits has been reached
rescue IdealPostcodes::IdealPostcodesError => e
	# API Error
rescue => e
	# An unexpected error
end
```

Possible errors to look out for are listed in the [documentation](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/documentation/response-codes).

## Methods

The client provides a number of methods to allow you to get specific jobs done quickly and easily. These methods are listed below.




## Get all addresses for a postcode [(docs)](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/documentation/postcodes#postcode)

```
IdealPostcodes::Postcode.lookup postcode
```

Returns an array of addresses representing all addresses at the specified postcode.

**Arguments**

- `postcode` (string). The postcode you want to lookup, case and space insensitive.

**Returns**

An array of hashes which represent each address at the postcode. Returns an empty array for an invalid postcode.

else
	puts addresses
end

# addresses =>
#[
#  {
#   :postcode => "ID1 1QD",
#   :post_town => "LONDON",

## Utility Methods

Listed below are free utility methods, e.g. finding the status of your key.

### Find out if your key is in a usable state [(docs)](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/documentation/keys#key)

Find out if your key is in a usable state. E.g. it has a positive balance, it is currently under your defined usage limits, etc.

```
IdealPostcodes.key_available
```

**Arguments**

None.

**Returns**

- availability (Boolean). Returns true if key can be used. False if something is preventing the key from making lookups e.g. insufficient balance, reached limits, etc.

**Example**

```ruby
IdealPostcodes.key_available # => true, you're clear to make lookups
```

### Retrieve private key information [(docs)](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/documentation/keys#details)

This method reveals private information about your key such as the lookup balance, whitelisted URLs, etc. Note: a secret key is required to invoke this method.

```
IdealPostcodes.key_details
```

**Arguments**

None.

**Returns**

Returns a hash containing pertinent private information about your key.

**Example**

```ruby
IdealPostcodes.key_details

# {
# 	:lookups_remaining=>9678, 
# 	:daily_limit=>{
# 		:limit=>100, 
# 		:consumed=>1
# 	}, 
# 	:individual_limit=>{
# 		:limit=>15
# 	}, 
# 	:allowed_urls=>["foo.com"], 
# 	:notifications=>{
# 		:emails=>["bar@baz.com"], 
# 	:enabled=>true}, 
# 	:automated_topups=>{
# 		:enabled=>true
# 	}
# }
```

If you intend to use this method, you must pass your secret key (which can be found on your [account page](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/account)) along with your API key when instantiating the client. E.g.

```ruby
IdealPostcodes.apply_secret "your secret key"
```

Do not share your secret key and avoid commiting this key to your codebase.
